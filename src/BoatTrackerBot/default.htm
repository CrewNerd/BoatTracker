    <h1>BoatTracker Bot</h1>
    <p>
        BoatTracker is a fleet management system for rowing and paddling clubs. It uses the
         <a href="http://bookedscheduler.com">BookedScheduler</a> system
        as a platform for managing the reservation and use of the club's equipment. On top of that, BoatTracker adds
        a conversational front end for club members to make and manage their reservations, and to check into and check
        out of their reservations. The bot can be accessed via Skype, Facebook Messenger, and SMS. In addition, a web
        page showing upcoming, active, and overdue reservations can be displayed on a kiosk (iPad or Android) in the
        boathouse. A daily report is emailed to the club's designated administrator listing unused reservations as well
        as various policy violations.
